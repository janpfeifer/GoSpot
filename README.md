## How to Play

Welcome to **GoSpot**! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janpfeifer/GoSpot/main/web/images/symbol_00.png" height="24" style="vertical-align: middle"> The game is simple, fast, and tons of fun. Here is how you play:

- **The Setup <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janpfeifer/GoSpot/main/web/images/symbol_12.png" height="24" style="vertical-align: middle">**: Every player starts with the same number of circular cards. One card is placed face-up in the middle of the table—this is the **target card**.
- **The Goal <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janpfeifer/GoSpot/main/web/images/symbol_25.png" height="24" style="vertical-align: middle">**: Your top card and the target card ALWAYS share exactly **ONE matching symbol**. Your job is to spot it before anyone else!
- **Spot it! <img src="web/images/symbol_33.png" height="24" style="vertical-align: middle">**: As soon as you see the matching symbol between your card and the target card, click it as quickly as possible! 
- **Discard & Repeat <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janpfeifer/GoSpot/main/web/images/symbol_45.png" height="24" style="vertical-align: middle">**: If you're the first to click the right symbol, your top card moves to the middle and becomes the *new* target card for everyone.
- **Winning <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janpfeifer/GoSpot/main/web/images/symbol_56.png" height="24" style="vertical-align: middle">**: The first player to get rid of all their cards wins the game!

### Special Rules

- **Penalties <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janpfeifer/GoSpot/main/web/images/symbol_07.png" height="24" style="vertical-align: middle">**: Be careful! If you click on a symbol that *doesn't* match, you'll get a penalty (a red aura will appear around you) and your clicks will be ignored for a couple of seconds.
- **Mega Discard <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janpfeifer/GoSpot/main/web/images/symbol_19.png" height="24" style="vertical-align: middle">**: When you log in, you choose a special "player symbol" to represent you. If you win a round by matching YOUR player symbol, you get to discard **3 cards** at once instead of just 1!

Gather your friends, start a table, and see who has the fastest eyes! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janpfeifer/GoSpot/main/web/images/symbol_03.png" height="24" style="vertical-align: middle"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janpfeifer/GoSpot/main/web/images/symbol_42.png" height="24" style="vertical-align: middle"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janpfeifer/GoSpot/main/web/images/symbol_50.png" height="24" style="vertical-align: middle">
